# Software-engineering-Portfolio-
Team Portfolio represents a collaborative Software Engineering project where we applied real-world software development practices to design, implement, and evaluate a functional application prototype



TEAM PORTFOLIO WEBSITE

This repository contains our collaborative Team Portfolio Website, developed as part of the Software Engineering Programming Assignment at ENSIA.
The purpose of this project was to apply real-world software engineering practices using Git and GitHub, following the feature-branch workflow, pull requests, and peer review.
Our final website is deployed using GitHub Pages.

TEAM RETROSPECTIVE ANALYSIS

Technical Challenge

The most significant technical challenge our team faced was managing merge conflicts in the index.html file. Since every member had to edit the same section to add their profile link, conflicts occurred frequently when merging different branches into the develop branch.
At first, it was confusing to understand how Git recognized overlapping changes and why conflicts appeared. To overcome this, we improved our communication and started synchronizing our branches regularly using the command “git pull origin develop” before making new commits.also , some changes required a manully handling .


Merge Conflict Resolution Process

One major conflict happened when two members modified the same part of index.html simultaneously. Git showed the conflicting code sections using special markers, separating each version.
We opened the file, carefully reviewed both changes, and decided to keep both lines by placing each member’s name on its own line.
After editing, we ran:
git add index.html
git commit -m "fix: resolve merge conflict in index.html"
This resolved the issue and updated the shared branch without losing any data.
This incident helped us better understand manual conflict resolution and how to maintain a clean version history.

Pull Request and Peer Review Evaluation

The pull request system played an essential role in improving our project’s organization and quality. Each member worked on their own feature branch, then submitted a pull request to merge into develop.
Before merging, another team member had to review the code and approve it. This process helped us identify small errors early, maintain consistent formatting, and ensure that every file followed the same structure.
By reviewing each other’s code, we learned different coding styles and improved our collaboration. In the end, our project became more polished and coherent thanks to peer reviews and structured workflow.



This project represents our team’s shared effort, communication, and learning throughout the development process, we gave it so much time and effort and the learned lessons was worth it .
