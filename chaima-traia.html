    <section class="about">
      <p>
        I’m a curious and detail-oriented software engineering student who enjoys turning ideas into clean, functional, and well-structured projects. I’m passionate about understanding how things work — not just making them work — and I take pride in writing organized, purposeful code.

I approach every challenge with patience and persistence, believing that every bug or error is an opportunity to learn something new. I value teamwork, structure, and clear communication, and I’m always eager to improve both my technical skills and my collaborative mindset.

Beyond coding, I appreciate thoughtful design, problem-solving, and building projects that are both practical and elegant. My goal is to grow as a developer who writes code that not only works — but makes sense.</p>
